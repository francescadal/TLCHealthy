                        <p class="lead">For more than 43 years, TLC Healthy Communities has never underestimated the ability of young people to overcome challenges and heal, learn, and flourish.

                        Our private nonprofit provides an array of medical, educational, and daily living services designed to maximize the independence of those with special health care needs. The Center provides a network of care for individuals at all stages of development, from the most technologically-dependent and medically fragile to those with mild developmental delays. From premature infants to young adults, we are focused on developing and delivering the very best care necessary to ensure each individual is given every opportunity to thrive and succeed.

                        By listening to and learning from the families we partner with, the Center has grown from a single program in 1971 to one that improves thousands of lives through a dozen programs serving the tri-county area, the state, and nation. Our mission is to respond to the unique needs of every child through programs that promote privacy, respect, independence, dignity, and engagement (PRIDE).</p>
